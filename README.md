# Read-me-generator-9
A way to create a professional README for a new project from the command line


when given a command-line application that accepts user input I am prompted for information about my application repository,Then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

When I enter my project information then it is displayed in the proper locations 

When I choose a license for my application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under,

when I enter my GitHub information then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.

When I click on the links in the Table of Contents
then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
